At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized.

If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice. \n\n## Do California residents have specific privacy rights? \u003ca name=\"section11\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\n***In Short:***  *Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.*\n\nCalifornia Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the \"Shine The Light\" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year.
